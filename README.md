I'm a data analyst interested in machine learning.  I enjoy analyzing data and using ML techniques to uncover patterns, solve problems, and give insights that drive informed decision-making. I am interested in connecting with like-minded professionals to share knowledge. I am also open to collaborative opportunities and team projects.
